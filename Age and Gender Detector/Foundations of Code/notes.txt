Each language also has an attribute known as power or level (basically how similar it is to machine code)
Low level programming languages: Assembly, C
High level programming languages: Java, Python
Lower the level -> More similar to machine code

We use IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) to write code (A place to write, run, debug code and also convert it to machine code)
It is used for facilitation of code. (Examples: NetBeans, IntelliJ, Visual Studios)
