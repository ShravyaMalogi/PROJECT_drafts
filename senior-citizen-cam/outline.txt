### **1. Objective**

Develop a real-time or video-based machine learning system that:

* Detects multiple persons in a frame (webcam or video).
* Predicts each person’s age and gender.
* Classifies persons aged **>60** as **senior citizens**.
* Logs age, gender, and timestamp to a CSV/Excel file.

---

### **2. Project Components**

#### **A. Data Collection / Preparation**

* Gather or use an existing dataset with **face images**, **age labels**, and **gender labels** (e.g., UTKFace, IMDB-WIKI).
* Preprocess data (resizing, normalization, data augmentation if needed).

#### **B. Model Development**

* Train a **custom age and gender prediction model** (multi-output CNN).
* Optimize for real-time inference (consider lightweight architectures if needed).
* Ensure the model performs well on age classification (±10 years) and gender classification.

#### **C. Real-Time Detection Pipeline**

* Use a **face detection model** (e.g., OpenCV, MTCNN, or YOLO) to detect people in the video feed.
* For each detected face:

  * Crop the face.
  * Predict **age** and **gender**.
  * If age > 60, label them as a **senior citizen**.

#### **D. Logging Mechanism**

* Record the following details into a **CSV or Excel** file:

  * Age
  * Gender
  * Time of Visit (using `datetime`)

#### **E. Optional GUI (if included)**

* Display real-time video feed with:

  * Bounding boxes
  * Predicted age & gender
  * Highlight senior citizens
* Button to export or view the log file

### **3. Evaluation Criteria**

* Functional age and gender prediction
* Real-time/multi-person detection performance
* Logging accuracy (CSV/Excel)
* Model performance (accuracy, speed)
* (Optional) GUI effectiveness

---

### **4. Deliverables**

* Trained model (.h5 or .pt)
* Inference script (video/webcam)
* Logging mechanism (CSV/Excel output)
* Readme with instructions
* (Optional) GUI application
* GitHub repository with code and documentation
